    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
        This course is intended for students who are new to web development,
        although it could serve as a good refresher for self-taught front-end
        developers or an intro to front-end for back-end developers. General
        experience with computers and technology is benefitial, but the discussion
        is completely self-contained.

        The final exam will be hands-on. Be prepared to build a simple, but realistic
        web site with a similar amount of content, quality of presentation, and amount of
        interactivity to that of those we have built for assignments.
